# SideMenu

SwiftUI Side Menu Example

This example works in iOS13 and iOS14. 

Example will work in Landscape or Portrait mode.

The Menu Handel is used to pull out the Menu List View, and you can also close it.

There is also a LogoutView and LoginView along with RegisterView and ForgotPasswordView.

For iOS13 it uses KeyboardGuardian to move the TextField up over the keyboard.
